# Assembly-Programming

For this problem, you will be writing MIPS assembly to sort an array of strings.
The first step in this task is to write the code in C. This function takes an array of strings (i.e., a char**), and a count of how many strings are in the array. You should sort the array “in place” (that is, modifying ordering of the char*s in the array) into ascending order (smallest string first). 
The second step in this task is to write the code in MIPS Assembly. This function should work exactly like your C version, which you should use as a guide.
You will need to follow the MIPS calling conventions.
